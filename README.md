# SturdyScribe

Super early development. Expect bugs and bad UI. 

Available at [SturdyScribe](https://takerudev.github.io/sturdy-scribe).

## About Tavern Support

I aim to support the minimum set of features available in the latest version of the [YukiTavern](https://github.com/yukikun-dev/yukitavern) fork. If there's something from the latest SillyTavern that you feel should be supported in SturdyScribe, [create an issue](https://github.com/takerudev/sturdy-scribe/issues).

Enjoy, lorebookmakies.
